# pointu

pointu is a tool to render images with points of varying sizes and colors in an artistic way. The implementation is based on [Adrian Secord](https://cs.nyu.edu/~ajsecord/)'s 2002 [paper](https://mrl.nyu.edu/~ajsecord/npar2002/npar2002_ajsecord_preprint.pdf) entitled "*Weighted Voronoi Stippling*". The name *pointu* is derived from [*pointillism*](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pointillism), a painting technique in which points are used to form an image.
